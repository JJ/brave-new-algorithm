% What's the point of new metaheuristics.
One of the {\em koans} written by Goldberg in ``Zen and the art of the
evolutionary algorithm'' states that we should Nature be our guide. This has
profitably led to many different population-based metaheuristics that are
inspired by the behavior of different species \cite{nedjah2020inspiration}, going as far as the behavior of
pigeons in a park \cite{blanco2019urban}. The exhaustion of the pool of
species with collective behavior to mimick has led further away, for instance to
zombies \cite{nguyen2012zombie}, which eventually has led to backlash
\cite{metaphor_exposed} claiming how metaphors obscure understanding of new
algorithms, and do not advance the field of optimization.

This does not imply, however, that metaphors are necessarily unhelpful.
