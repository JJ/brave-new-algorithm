\section{Introduction}

% Introduce the problem: diversity in metaheuristics/global optimization problems
Population-based algorithms \cite{prugel2010benefits} are global optimization, stochastic
methods that use different techniques for exploring the search space
in such a way that it makes finding the solution feasible in a
reasonable amount of time. As such, they must strike a balance between
feasibility (exploitation of the features found in the current
population of solutions to optimize fitness) and off-line performance
(exploration of parts of the search space that might hold the key to
those solutions) \cite{xu2014exploration}. And in this balance,
diversity is one of the keys \cite{alba2005exploration}. This drives
the search for new algorithms that explicitly try to keep this balance
in a {\em comfort zone}.

In this search, inspiration may arrive from unexpected places.
At the beginning of the year one of the authors read the famous book
by Aldous Huxley: A brave new world \cite{huxley2007brave}. The novel
is a distopy that describes the development in reproductive
technology, psychological manipulation (including virtual-reality
plays called {\em feelies} \cite{lecakes2021matrix}) and classical
conditioning \cite{bernheim2002addiction}. It introduced interesting
ideas in several areas, but in this paper we are going to focus in how
they optimize the population.

In order to maximize efficiency and decrease unhappiness, the book
describes how the population is divided in \textit{castes}, assigned
since birth, where everyone knows and accepts their place. That way,
they achieve an ``optimum world``, whose optimization is based on
these reproduction restrictions and in the overall balance the division in
castes creates, not in an individual. This tension between the
individual happiness or realization and the overall harmony or optimal
state is, precisely, the main plot driver, becoming a literary
harbinger of the comparison between individual and population-based
optimization algorithms, although of course the intention of the
author was to compare collectivist and individualist culture
\cite{mathews2012happiness}.

When we talk about evolutionary algorithms the target is reaching the optimum
solution for a problem, and this book perfectly describes the process through
which they have reached the perfect human race. Therefore we want to develop an
algorithm based on the book's fecundation proceses and compare its behaviour
with a basic genetic algorithm. Our main assumption during the design of this process is
that the division in castes affects the poblation's diversity; we can draw a
parallel between the collectivism/individualism tensions inherent in the novel
and the exploration/exploitation balance in population based global algorithms,
and thus try and apply their solutions to our problems. The main conclusion we
draw from the book is that what makes collective society happy might make some
individuals extremely isolated and sad; but if we apply this to our optimization
realm we can see that what Aldous Huxley might be unwittingly proposing is the
rough layout of an optimization algorithm, where individuals with different
fitnesses undergo different differentiation/evolution/reproduction processes. We
will take it from here to design an optimization algorithm, which of course we
call {\sf Brave New Algorithm}. Essentially, {\sf BNA} is an evolutionary
algorithm with mating restrictions and, additionally, differentiated application
of operators depending on the fitness value.

When designing an algorithm from scratch, we must also make technical
choices on how this implementation is going to take place, as well as
how the whole process of going from design (our {\em user stories}) to
final implementation (product) can be performed according to best
practices in software engineering. Implementation matters
\cite{merelo2011implementation}, and an agile development process can
help us get the final result in the most efficient way, guaranteeing
the quality of any software product \cite{agile_manifesto}. This manifesto also
encourages open science, which is the model that we are following from the onset
of this research line.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: next, the state of the art in
this area is examined. The algorithm (and its implementation) are described in
\ref{sec:algorithm} and \ref{sec:implementation}. The first experiments
performed with this implementation of the algorithm are shown in
\ref{sec:experiments}. Finally, we will discuss the results and present our
conclusions in Section \ref{sec:conc}.
