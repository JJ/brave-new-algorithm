\section{Introduction}

% Introduce the problem: diversity in metaheuristics/global optimization problems

At the beginning of the year one of the authors read the famous book by Aldous Huxley: A brave new world  \cite{huxley2007brave}. The novel
is a distopy that describes the development in reproductive technology, psychological manipulation (including virtual-reality plays called {\em feelies} \cite{lecakes2021matrix})  and classical conditioning \cite{bernheim2002addiction}.
The population is divided in \textit{castes}, assigned since birth, where everyone knows and accepts their place. We are
talking about a ``optimum world``, whose optimization is based on the population and in the balance the division in 
castes creates, not in an individual.

When we talk about evolutionary algorithms the target is reaching the optimum solution for a problem., and this books
perfectly describes the process through which they have reached the perfect human race. Thereforth we want to develop
an algorithm based on the book's fecundation proceses and compare its behaviour with other algorithms. Also, investigating
how the division in castes affects the poblation's diveristy.
