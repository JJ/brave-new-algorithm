\begin{abstract}

At the beginning of this year one of the authors read `A brave new
world` by Aldous Huxley.  The Nobel describes a dystopia, which
anticipates the development of breeding technology, and how this
technology creates the perfect human race. Taking into account that
when talking about genetic algorithms our goal is to achieve the
optimum solution of a problem, and this book kind of describes the
process for making the “perfect human”, or rather the ``perfect human
population'', we will try to work on this parallelism in this paper,
trying to find what is the key to the evolution processes described in
the book. The goal is to develop a Genetic algorithm based on the
fecundation process of the book and compare it to other algorithms to
see how it behaves, by investigating how the division in castes
affects the diversity in the poblation.
