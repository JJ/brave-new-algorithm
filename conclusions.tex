\section{Discussion and conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

We began the paper asking ourselves how the division in castes affected
the diversity of the algorithm, with the goal in mind of making the algorithm avoid getting stuck
in local optima as late as possible. We took the entropy as the metric for measuring this, and
through the different experiments we've reached the conclusion that the division make
the algorithm keep the diversity more generations than the basic genetic algorithm. 

For future works on this algorithm it would be interesting to label all the individuals in
the population and investigate how they move between the different castes. Also, explore
how the diversity behaves when talking about Multiobjective Optimization Problems.
